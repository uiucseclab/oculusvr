This exploit uses a webcam capture library to take a picture from the specified webcam
and then either save it to file or send it to a designated computer. The program is
written in Java and takes one argument, the name of the file it should output to. 

The IP address and port is hardcoded into the program (by default, it is localhost 
and port 6880).
